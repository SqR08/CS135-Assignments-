;; 2(a)
;; (m/s->mph speed) consumes a speed in the units m/s and produces the same
;; speed in units of mph
;; m/s->mph: Num -> Num
;; Examples:
(check-expect (m/s->mph 2) 6250/1397)

(define (m/s->mph speed)
 (* speed 3600000/1609344))

;;Tests:
(check-expect (m/s->mph 0) 0)
(check-expect (m/s->mph -2) -6250/1397)
